# FSP Network RFCs

[FSP Network RFCs]: #fsp-network-rfcs

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the FSP Network and the [sub-teams](https://github.com/orgs/FSPNet/teams).

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the network, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction the network is evolving in.
